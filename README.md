# Data-Cleaning-with-Mankind-s-Christmas-Gift

-- Pick randomly any of these steps to clean up the dataset in Excel:
1.	Remove Blank Rows
Select the entire data range Go to the Home tab > Select Data > Remove Duplicates Check the "Remove Duplicates" box and click OK to remove any fully blank rows
2.	Handle Missing Values
Use the Find and Replace tool (Ctrl+H) to locate missing values like blanks or ?'s Replace them with a consistent missing value indicator like "N/A" or "-"
3.	Fix Inconsistent Data Entry
Use Find and Replace to standardize entries (e.g. kids -> child, tshirt -> t-shirt) Create custom data validation lists for columns with pre-defined options
4.	Split/Combine Columns
If names/addresses are smushed together, use Text to Columns to split them If you have separate columns for first/last name, use CONCATENATE to combine
5.	Remove Duplicates
Select the entire data range Go to Data tab > Remove Duplicates Check the columns you want to check for duplicates and click OK
6.	Check for Outliers/Anomalies
Use conditional formatting to highlight numbers/dates outside expected ranges Double check any outliers are not data entry errors

-- Be sure to create a backup of your original data before cleaning. With a few easy steps, your Christmas gift data will be shipshape!
